# SignalProcessing

This project was created during the Covid-19 pandemic before I was able to start my career.
While I was applying for openings, I wished to strengthen my knowledge of both Python and Signal Processing.
After reviewing Python using Codecademy, I developed the idea for a project which creates a sound file which is able to draw images into a spectrogram.

This program will, ideally, act as a building block to a larger project. This project will, in the future, find lines within photographs and, using machine learning, create sound files 
which create the provided images in the spectrogram.
